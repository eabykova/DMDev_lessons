A Fairy Song by William Shakespeare

Over hill, over dale,88888888
Thorough bush, thorough brier,
Over park, over pale,
Thorough flood, thorough fire!
4444I do wander 44 everywhere,
Swifter than the moon's sphere;
And I serve the Fairy Queen,
To dew her orbs 66666666 upon the green;
The cowslips tall her pensioners be;
In their gold coats spots you see;
Those be rubies, fairy favours;
In those freckles live their savours;
I must go seek some dewdrops here,
And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
